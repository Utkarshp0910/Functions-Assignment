        "#Ques 1- What is the difference between a function and a method in Python?\"\"\"\n",
        "\"\"\"Answer - Function: A block of reusable code that works independently and can be called anywhere in your program.\n",
        "Method: A function tied to an object. It is called on that object and can only work with its data.\"\"\"\n",
        "\n",
        "#Ques 2- Explain the concept of function arguments and parameters in Python.\n",
        "\"\"\"Answer - In Python, parameters are variables listed in a function's definition to receive inputs, while arguments are the actual values passed to the function when you call it.\"\"\"\n",
        "\n",
        "#Ques 3- What are the different ways to define and call a function in Python?\n",
        "\"\"\"Answer - Functions in Python are defined using the def keyword, followed by a name, parameters in parentheses, and a body containing the code to execute. They are called by writing the function name followed by parentheses, with any required arguments inside the parentheses.\"\"\"\n",
        "\n",
        "#Ques 4- What is the purpose of the `return` statement in a Python function?\n",
        "\"\"\"Answer - The `return` statement in a Python function is used to send a value back to the caller, allowing the function to produce a result that can be stored or used in further operations.\"\"\"\n",
        "\n",
        "#Ques 5- What are iterators in Python and how do they differ from iterables?\n",
        "\"\"\"Answer - Iterators in Python are objects that allow you to traverse through a sequence one element at a time using the `next()` function. Iterables are objects like lists, tuples, or strings that can be looped over, but they need to be converted to an iterator using the `iter()` function to access elements one by one.\"\"\"\n",
        "\n",
        "#Ques 6- Explain the concept of generators in Python and how they are defined.\n",
        "\"\"\"Answer - Generators in Python are a type of iterable, created using functions with the `yield` statement. Unlike regular functions, which return a value once and stop, generators yield a value each time the `next()` function is called, allowing them to produce a series of values lazily, one at a time. They are defined by using the `def` keyword and `yield` within the function body.\"\"\"\n",
        "\n",
        "#Ques 7- What are the advantages of using generators over regular functions?\n",
        "\"\"\"Answer - Generators offer several advantages over regular functions, including memory efficiency by generating values one at a time, reducing the need to store all values in memory at once. They also support lazy evaluation, producing values only when needed, which improves performance for large data sets. Additionally, generators are convenient for representing infinite sequences, as they can generate values on demand without causing memory overflow, unlike regular functions that would require storing all values.\"\"\"\n",
        "\n",
        "#Ques 8- What is a lambda function in Python and when is it typically used?\n",
        "\"\"\"Answer - A lambda function in Python is a small, anonymous function defined using the `lambda` keyword, followed by parameters, a colon, and an expression. It is typically used for short, throwaway functions where defining a full function with `def` would be unnecessary, such as when passing functions as arguments to higher-order functions like `map()`, `filter()`, or `sorted()`.\"\"\"\n",
        "\n",
        "#Ques 9- Explain the purpose and usage of the `map()` function in Python\n",
        "\"\"\"Answer - The `map()` function in Python is used to apply a given function to all items in an iterable (such as a list or tuple) and returns an iterator that produces the results. It is typically used when you want to transform or modify each element in an iterable without using an explicit loop. The syntax is `map(function, iterable)`, where `function` is the function to apply, and `iterable` is the collection of items.\"\"\"\n",
        "\n",
        "#Ques 10- What is the difference between map(), reduce(), and filter() functions in Python?\n",
        "\"\"\"Answer - The difference between `map()`, `reduce()`, and `filter()` functions in Python is as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "- `map()`: Applies a given function to each item in an iterable and returns an iterator of the results. It is used for transforming data.\n",
        "  Example: `map(function, iterable)`\n",
        "\n",
        "- `reduce()`: Applies a given function cumulatively to the items in an iterable, reducing the iterable to a single value. It is typically used for aggregation or combining values.\n",
        "  Example: `reduce(function, iterable)`\n",
        "\n",
        "- `filter()`: Applies a given function to each item in an iterable and returns an iterator of the items that evaluate to `True` (i.e., the function returns `True`). It is used for filtering data.\n",
        "  Example: `filter(function, iterable)`\"\"\"\n",
